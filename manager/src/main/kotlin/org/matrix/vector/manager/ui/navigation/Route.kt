 * SettingsRepository under `nav_panels` and are modelled by NavPanels. What is declared here is the
 * catalogue and the default.
 *
 * Hiding a panel never removes it from this file. The back stack persists NavKeys by class name —
 * NavKeySerializer resolves them with a bare `Class.forName` and has no fallback — and NavDisplay's
 * entryProvider throws for a key it was never given, so a saved stack naming a panel that had been
 * deleted would be a crash rather than a stale tab. Hiding is a fact about the navigation
 * container, and about nothing else.
